# Stock Market Price Prediction with Bidirectional LSTM

This project is an implementation of a stock market price prediction model using Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks with dropout layers. It is designed for time series forecasting and sequence prediction tasks, specifically for predicting stock prices.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately forecast future stock prices based on historical stock price data. This model leverages the power of Bidirectional LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the stock market data.

## Key Components

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive environment for data exploration, model development, and visualization.

- **Bidirectional LSTM**: The core of the model consists of Bidirectional LSTM layers, which allow the network to learn from both past and future time steps in the data sequence. This bidirectional approach is particularly effective for capturing complex dependencies.

- **Dropout Layers**: Dropout layers are added to the model for regularization. They help prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping out" a fraction of neurons during training.

## Data

To build and train the model, historical stock price data is required. You can use publicly available financial datasets or sources such as Yahoo Finance or APIs like Alpha Vantage to obtain historical stock price data.

## Setup and Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. You can do this by running the provided requirements.txt file or installing the required packages individually.

2. Obtain historical stock price data. The dataset should include features such as date, opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and volume.

3. Prepare the data for training and testing. This includes data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and possibly feature engineering.

4. Train the Bidirectional LSTM model using the Jupyter Notebook. Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different configurations as needed.

5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualization tools. Analyze the predictions and compare them to the actual stock prices.

6. Fine-tune the model if necessary, and use it for making future stock price predictions.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualization techniques like time series plots.

## Future Enhancements

To further improve the project, consider exploring the following areas:

- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
- Feature engineering to include additional relevant data.
- Implementing more advanced neural network architectures and ensembling techniques.
- Developing a user-friendly web application or API for stock price predictions.
